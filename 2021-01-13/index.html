<div class="comment-continuation">... issue 142 which is updating the CCG licenses</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... part of some of the cleanup of making sure all of the repos in the ccg are using the official approved ccg license</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... ken did a lot of work earlier to make sure we knew exactly what those licenses needed to be and then before the end of the year i went through and manually updated many</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... all with a few exceptions</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and tried to make a comment, you can see the exceptions</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-9').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-9').show()" id="9" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>: License exceptions: <a href="https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/142#issuecomment-751925176">https://github.com/w3c-ccg/community/issues/142#issuecomment-751925176</a> <a id="link-9" style="display:none;" href="#9">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are 5 repos that had other licenses associated with them so we&apos;re trying to clean those up</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot are LDS ones</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you are working on those can you take a look at the issues list? I&apos;ve put an issue in those repos to be able to get approval because they already have a license, we need to follow proper protocol that everyone working on the repo agrees to move over to CCG licenses</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... as I was doing this cleanup there were a lot of top level linked data repos and one of the things i&apos;d like to have a conversation about moving forward is can we have general linked data folder and all these methods of doing them can go underneath them? to clean up the repo structure of the CCG</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-10').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-10').show()" id="10" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  We should probably have a more in depth conversationa bout it, I understand the desire to organise everything under one repo, the issue has to do with IPR issues between the different methods <a id="link-10" style="display:none;" href="#10">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... while they&apos;re all linked data security related, some crypto suites have very different maturity, timelines, and the IPR stuff around it gets potentially confusing. We should talk about it a bit more</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;m concerned about putting it all in one</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-11').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-11').show()" id="11" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>:  That makes sense <a id="link-11" style="display:none;" href="#11">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we can put this up as an issue in an upcoming meeting. It&apos;s on my list, but after the election</div>
<h1 id="topic-3" class="topic">Topic: Election charter</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-12').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-12').show()" id="12" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  We need to decide what constitutes membership and have better language to be more inclusive of people who contribute to work items but are busy for a few months <a id="link-12" style="display:none;" href="#12">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... perhaps there is a requirement for meeting attendance, but you could do fewer meetings if you actively contribute to work items, we can have balance</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... will be ready by the end of the week</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-13').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-13').show()" id="13" class="comment"><span class="name">Heather Vescent</span>:  We&apos;ll have updated language to share, then leave a week for feedback and commentary, then after the community has accepted it we can kick off the election timeline <a id="link-13" style="display:none;" href="#13">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we should expect to get that charter data through email on the list?</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-14').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-14').show()" id="14" class="comment"><span class="name">Wayne Chang</span>:  Yep <a id="link-14" style="display:none;" href="#14">✪</a></div>
<h1 id="topic-4" class="topic">Topic: OCAPs/zCAPs</h1>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-15').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-15').show()" id="15" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  I&apos;m excited that we&apos;re having this conversation <a id="link-15" style="display:none;" href="#15">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I knew that in starting the thread that it would go somewhere and it&apos;s great to see this is where it is</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... before we get going I want to say one of the things I do is listen to the conversaiton across a wide range of the community</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I was worried that some folks were going to go off and invent / create something new to solve problems that another part of the community  had already been working on</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I want to invite collaboration sooner rather than later</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I want to start off by having Alan explain what an object capability is so we baseline for all those listening who dont&apos; know</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-16').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-16').show()" id="16" class="comment"><span class="name">Alan Karp</span>:  A capability or an OCAP is an unforgeable, transferable, permission to use the thing it designates <a id="link-16" style="display:none;" href="#16">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it combines designation with authorization</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-17').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-17').show()" id="17" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  Often it&apos;s contrasted with another security model known as an access control list (ACL) <a id="link-17" style="display:none;" href="#17">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-18').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-18').show()" id="18" class="comment"><span class="name">Alan Karp</span>:  An ACL specifically separates designation from authorization. When you make a request you prove your identity/role/attributes and the system looks up among your permissions if one of them matches the request you&apos;re making and then it will allow it <a id="link-18" style="display:none;" href="#18">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... searching over all of your permissions is the fatal flaw in ACLs</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-19').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-19').show()" id="19" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  Questions related to understanding what we&apos;re talking about <a id="link-19" style="display:none;" href="#19">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-20').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-20').show()" id="20" class="comment"><span class="name">David Chadwick</span>:  &quot;The fatal flaw&quot; - I would say it&apos;s a major benefit as well <a id="link-20" style="display:none;" href="#20">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it might be a flaw to some, but to others it&apos;s a benefit to have a level of indirection between the assignment and presentation and gaining access</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-21').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-21').show()" id="21" class="comment"><span class="name">Chris Webber</span>:  It might also be useful to frame how this has come up in this community <a id="link-21" style="display:none;" href="#21">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which is that at the time of the zcap-ld spec, there was already another spec in this space</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s come up whether there ought to be two specs. The other is the verifiable credentails spec</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which is about claims that x says y about z</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s largely about information provenance</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s completely possible to build an authority system on top of claims about identities</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and when you do that you&apos;ll notice it resembles strongly alan&apos;s description of the ACL system</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there have been some, the concerns from the ocap perspective about why we want them separate, it is valuable ot be able to describe claims about what has happened, properties about identities, so VC makes sense</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the risk is you want to have a couple of thing specifically separated</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one is that you could accidentally end up building your system such that it has the vulnerabilities that ACLs have of ambient authority and confused deputies</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the second thing is that there are the zcap-ld spec is very specific and limited in the kind of terminology it permits</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it includes a way to hook into things like an arbiter deciding whether something should happen, but does not have the space for attaching some other information other than here is who we give it out to and here are the caveats on which it is valid</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which can be viewed in a programmatic way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and here is an invocation making use of one of those capabilities</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a reason to bring this up is that one of the debates is how would you encode something such as the ...</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-22').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-22').show()" id="22" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  I was just trying to have people ask really basic questions about what are we talking about <a id="link-22" style="display:none;" href="#22">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-23').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-23').show()" id="23" class="comment"><span class="name">Alan Karp</span>:  To respond to David, chris mentioned the real flaw with ACLs is the confused deputy vulnerability that is unavoidable <a id="link-23" style="display:none;" href="#23">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and you don&apos;t lose that separation, that feature you get with ACLs, because you can use the ACL to decide what capability to grant to someone</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... all your structure for role/attribute based access control is valid, it&apos;s when you use it that matters</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you use it when you want to grant the authority, not when someone wants to use one</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-24').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-24').show()" id="24" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  I hope folks have grasped the core aspects <a id="link-24" style="display:none;" href="#24">✪</a></div>
<div class="information">&lt;manu&gt; omg, I&apos;m so happy this call is happening.</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-25').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-25').show()" id="25" class="comment"><span class="name">Dave Longley</span>: +1 And another way of putting it is that capabilities provide an *additional* abstraction on top of a role-based system, it doesn&apos;t take away <a id="link-25" style="display:none;" href="#25">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-26').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-26').show()" id="26" class="comment"><span class="name">Daniel Hardman</span>:  We needed a general mechanism to explain how all vcs can explain where data came from <a id="link-26" style="display:none;" href="#26">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... authorization data is one kind, and you can use it to construct a chain of delegation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... which is a feature you need with ocap type things</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and also use it to say, you&apos;re a small mom&amp;pop employer with 5 employees but when you creeate an employee credential for them you insert the name of th employee in the credential and you want to say I got this data off their passport</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so the name has a greater reputation associated with it than just your reputation as a mom&amp;pop business that nobody has heard of</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... attaching provenance to that kind of claim, and about claims about authority, felt like the same problem</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-27').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-27').show()" id="27" class="comment"><span class="name">Sam Smith</span>:  I&apos;m trying to solve the automated reasoning problem in a decentralized world where information flows between disparate entities <a id="link-27" style="display:none;" href="#27">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... security guarantees about that information require cross entity flow</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the mechanism for enabling that means i need to be able to securely attribute information thorughotu the system</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when you use the term verifiable in VCs, people understand it means verify the authenticity, but most people think it means verify the accuracy or veracity of the data in the credential</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... but what we really want is secure attribution</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if i think about automated reasoning, it&apos;s satisfaction, goals and constraints in order to make a decision, to take action</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so I want to provenance all of the information that i use because the info comes from a sauce that is not authentic I can&apos;t trust it</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... so regardless of its accuracy, if i can&apos;t attribute it, i shouldn&apos;t include it in my decision making process</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the whole idea of building security attributed provenance is a super semantic, a baseline for a decentralized world</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it requires some form of chaining</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if you&apos;re provanancing information and doing decision making you&apos;ll likely have not a chain but a tree or a graph</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... an attribution graph</div>

<div onmouseout="$('#link-29').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-29').show()" id="29" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  We&apos;ll get to the middle of the conversation! <a id="link-29" style="display:none;" href="#29">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... trying not to go into the weeds, trying to support folks not in the original conversation</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of people did not read 40,000 words and follow the whole thing</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-30').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-30').show()" id="30" class="comment"><span class="name">Chris Webber</span>:  I have a response to the checking of information and provenance chains.. it relates to one of the emails.. but it does go into the weeds <a id="link-30" style="display:none;" href="#30">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-31').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-31').show()" id="31" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  Let&apos;s wait for the weeds <a id="link-31" style="display:none;" href="#31">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I know manu didn&apos;t chime in much, so I&apos;d love to hear from manu what you would like our audience to understand about it</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-32').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-32').show()" id="32" class="comment"><span class="name">Manu Sporny</span>:  Largely it&apos;s a conversation that has been going on for a very long time. nearing decades. <a id="link-32" style="display:none;" href="#32">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and there are various people here approaching a set of problems from different perspectives which is really good</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I&apos;m really happy we&apos;re talking about this together</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... i&apos;m concerned about it&apos;s very easy to get lost in the weeds</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and leave a whole bunch of people behind when you&apos;re talking about the intricacies about what&apos;s better and what allows you to do more</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are a whole bunch of different use case that need to be looked at an analysed</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... everyone here has good intentions and wants to solve these problems in the best way</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... everyone is operating from good faith</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... nobody sees this set of discussions as a we&apos;re going to pick A or B. like there&apos;s an epic struggle. it&apos;s not that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and that there are going to be people who win or lose</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one of the strengths of the community is that you let many flowers bloom and see how that stuff happens in th emarket</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the main thing here is to make sure that folks are well aware of the concerns in all approaches</div>
<div class="information">&lt;alan_karp&gt; Kaliya, I&apos;d like to avoid discussing whether or not to use ocaps and focus on using VCs for ocaps.</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... before we go forward</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-33').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-33').show()" id="33" class="comment"><span class="name">Alan Karp</span>:  I think this meeting will do better if we avoid the question of whether or not to use ocaps, and focus on the thread which is whether VCs are the right vehicle for ocaps <a id="link-33" style="display:none;" href="#33">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-34').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-34').show()" id="34" class="comment"><span class="name">Kaliya Young</span>:  I&apos;d love to hear from the main protagonists in the thread talk about what the conversation was and where it got to <a id="link-34" style="display:none;" href="#34">✪</a></div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-35').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-35').show()" id="35" class="comment"><span class="name">Chris Webber</span>:  I think it&apos;s worthwhile trying to be illustrative of the differences <a id="link-35" style="display:none;" href="#35">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the classic VC example is a drivers license</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... we can imagine those used in a car driving scenario</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... another way we can think about things is whether or not how we can tell how far a car has been driven and how much gas is in the car</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you would look at the odometer and the fuel guage</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that would be a VC type approach. the fuel guage says x the odometer says y</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you&apos;re making a judgment about whether to trust the fuel guage and the odometer</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... they could be lying</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it&apos;s now the person who has received the VC who has the information</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one thing that is curios about certificate style capabilities is by encoding them as data we can replay time in a way that we can see what happened to find out what has occurred</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a different way to find out the gas and mileage is take your timelord friends blue box, travel back to when the car rolls of the lot and watch every time th e person starts driving and refuels the tank</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and calculate it up to that moment</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you could use a playback to find out the current state of the car</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... ohmigosh you have this information about what has occurred anyway</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that&apos;s another thing that contributes to the feeling that these are the same things</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... one of the things is reflective. one is about what they believe to be true, and one is about th ething is happening</div>
<div onmouseout="$('#link-36').hide()" onmouseover="$('#link-36').show()" id="36" class="comment"><span class="name">Alan Karp</span>:  My view of the discussion <a id="link-36" style="display:none;" href="#36">✪</a></div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I understand the discussion it&apos;s whether to have a separate standard for ocaps or include ocaps in the vc standard</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and the concerns that chris has raised are very valid</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... as the discussion went on the real point is there is a lot of boilerplate</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... how you sign, define namespaces</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... a lot of that can be reused</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... based on what alan just said, the discussion is about should ocaps be a separate spec or in VCs, that&apos;s a different quesiton than what started the discussion</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I want to be clear that we may be on two different planes now</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... the original point of the discussion was is there a way to securely provenance data where the provanence uses a chaining semantic</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it doesn&apos;t matter what the data is</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... as daniel said if I&apos;m chaining things there is a tendency to chain authorizations as long as i can chain anything else</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... is there a home for a chaining semantic?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if we have a chaining semantic for credentials, where would that home be?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... my hypothesis is the correct home for a chaining semantic, because there are many use cases that have nothing to do with authorization, where should that home be</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if it&apos;s the VC spec, the discussion is over</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and it&apos;s a different discussion to say what do we use that chaining semantic for?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... something about open loops</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... what cwebber2 said is getting at the distinction</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if&apos; I&apos;m doing open loop decision processes such as an event sourcing high volume application, I want to use a different sematnic than a closed loop reflective process</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you say I have to be ocap like / closed loop like, then I can&apos;t do certain things when I&apos;m doing an open loop decision making model</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... there are advantages to both but they&apos;re not the same and you can&apos;t make one be the other</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... they are fundamentally incompatible</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... I want to do open loop decision processes with VCs and i need a chaining semantic</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... is VC the right place to put a chaining semantic?</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if not, VCs are uninteresting to me</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... my feeling is that VCs are an evolution of the original ECMA attribute certificat model in the 1990s which was followed by x509</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... i had discussions with Alan in 2011 about this</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when we implemented the x509 attribute cert infra</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... at that time we agreed they can act as capabilities as well</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... when alan started today he said an ocap is an unforgeable transferable permission</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... it is an authorization token</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... you can use VCs to do both</div>

<div class="comment-continuation">... through that conversation part of the thing was a lot of these properties look very similar so could we reuse them</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... that&apos;s a positive conversation to have</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if we can reuse properties if they are behaving the same across both i see no reason not to</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... if there&apos;s a way they are behaving differently we can use a different property</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... let&apos;s reuse the ones we can</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... sounded like increasing consensus on that</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... on what type is chosen?  I think the important thing is that since the use of verifiable credentials vs the use of zcaps or ocaps are very different, because zcaps have a specific algorithm that includes the caveats mechanism, whcih is different that VCs are</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... and that there are additional properties you may want to attach to a VC that should not apply to whether or not to accept a capability invocation as valid</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... this is important because you want to be able to reply everything and end up in the same state which might not happen otherwise</div>
<div class="comment-continuation">... i agree there is an opportunity for collaboration where we can reduce the friction between to two</div>
